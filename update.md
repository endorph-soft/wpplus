# Whirlpool Plus needs an update
Whirlpool underwent a major update in April 2015, and it looks like you're running an older version of WP+ that doesn't support the new site. 

You won't be able to access Whirlpool until you update WP+, or disable the script entirely.

Please [update to the latest version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endorph-soft/wpplus/master/whirlpool_plus.user.js) to continue using Whirlpool with WP+.

If you're having trouble, disable WP+ and visit the [WP+ Thread](https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=2358061). Someone should be able to give you a hand.
